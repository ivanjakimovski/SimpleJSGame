# Very Simple JavaScript HTML5 Prototype Canvas Game

This is a simple plain JavaScript HTML5 Canvas game.

Just open the index.html in a browser and hit any key to jump and avoid the obstacles.

Keep in mind that it is not really a finished product, it's just a simple prototype concept that expresses the possibilities with HTML5 Canvas, so there is buggy behaviour while playing and it definitely needs some polishing in order to get better.

After the Score reaches 20 the game speeds up.
